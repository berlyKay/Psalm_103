    <h1>Psalm 103</h1>

    <!-- <h4><strong>Praise for the LORD’s Mercies</strong></h4> -->
    <h4><em>A Psalm of David.</h4></em>
    <div>
        <p>
            1   Bless the LORD, O my soul;<br>
                And all that is within me, bless His holy name!<br>
            2   Bless the LORD, O my soul,<br>
                And forget not all His benefits:<br>
            3   Who forgives all your iniquities,<br>
                Who heals all your diseases,<br>
            4   Who redeems your life from destruction,<br>
                Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies,<br>
            5   Who satisfies your mouth with good things,<br>
                So that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            6   The LORD executes righteousness<br>
                And justice for all who are oppressed.<br>
            7   He made known His ways to Moses,<br>
                His acts to the children of Israel.<br>
            8   The LORD is merciful and gracious,<br>
                Slow to anger, and abounding in mercy.<br>
            9   He will not always strive with us,<br>
                Nor will He keep His anger forever.<br>
            10  He has not dealt with us according to our sins,<br>
                Nor punished us according to our iniquities.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            11  For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br>
                So great is His mercy toward those who fear Him;<br>
            12  As far as the east is from the west,<br>
                So far has He removed our transgressions from us.<br>
            13  As a father pities his children,<br>
                So the LORD pities those who fear Him.<br>
            14  For He knows our frame;<br>
                He remembers that we are dust.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            15  As for man, his days are like grass;<br>
                As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.<br>
            16  For the wind passes over it, and it is gone,<br>
                And its place remembers it no more.<br>
            17  But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting<br>
                On those who fear Him,<br>
                And His righteousness to children’s children,<br>
            18  To such as keep His covenant,<br>
                And to those who remember His commandments to do them.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            19  The Lord has established His throne in heaven,<br>
                And His kingdom rules over all.<br>
            20  Bless the Lord, you His angels,<br>
                Who excel in strength, who do His word,<br>
                Heeding the voice of His word.<br>
            21  Bless the Lord, all you His hosts,<br>
                You ministers of His, who do His pleasure.<br>
            22  Bless the Lord, all His works,<br>
                In all places of His dominion.<br><br>

                Bless the Lord, O my soul!
