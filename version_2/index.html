            Here's the challenge!<br><br>
            Memorize and meditate on only the first verse 
            for at least a week. Try to keep reading the whole chapter once
            a day, but keep your focus throughout the day on verse one.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">Current verse: Psalm 103:1 NKJV<br><br>
            Bless the Lord,<br>
            O my soul;<br>
            And all that is within me,<br>
            bless His holy name!<br>
        </p>

        <p class="ponderings"> My ponderings:<br><br>

            Today, we would more likely reverse the order of this phrase and 
            say, "O my soul, bless the Lord." I love to ponder every single word in a 
            Bible verse. For example, is there a meaning behind the "O" in this phrase?
            
            Think about the difference between saying, "Please help me," and "Oh, 
            please help me." Do you feel the difference? The "Oh" adds a note of 
            despair, evoking an emotional response.
        </p>

        <p class="more">I believe the author, David, is pleading with us to "bless the Lord". 
            As you memorize this first verse, I hope you will meditate on why 
            David would plead with us to do this. And perhaps, seek out 
            what it even means to "bless the Lord"!
        </p>
        
        <p class="extra">What about the words, "my soul"? What does that truly mean?
            Maybe you want to ponder the phrase, 'all that is within me'. Have you ever done
            something in your life with "all that is within you"? How about studying what "holy" means?
            Or consider why we are specifically told to bless His "name"? There is so much in this single verse!
